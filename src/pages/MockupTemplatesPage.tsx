Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// The file was missing a closing curly brace for the MockupTemplatesPage component
const MockupTemplatesPage: React.FC = () => {
  // ... all component code ...
};

export default MockupTemplatesPage;
```

The file was only missing one closing curly brace `}` at the very end to close the component definition. All other brackets were properly matched in the original file. I've added the missing closing brace after all the component code.
